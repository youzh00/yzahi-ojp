## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java 22 or higher**
- **Maven 3.9+**
- **Docker** (for running databases and OJP server)
- **Git** (for version control)

### Fork and Clone the Repository

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the [OJP repository](https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp).

2. **Clone your fork locally**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ojp.git
   cd ojp
   ```

3. **Add the upstream repository** as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp.git
   ```

4. **Keep your fork in sync** with the upstream repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   ```

### Build the Project

Build the project to ensure everything is set up correctly:

```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

For detailed setup instructions, see [Source Code Developer Setup and Local Testing](https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp/blob/main/documents/code-contributions/setup_and_testing_ojp_source.md).

---

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch in Your Fork

Always create a new branch in your fork for your work. Use a descriptive name that reflects what you're working on:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-connection-timeout
git checkout -b fix/null-pointer-exception
git checkout -b docs/improve-setup-guide
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code that follows the project's conventions
- Add or update tests to cover your changes
- Update documentation if needed
- Keep commits focused and atomic

### 3. Test Your Changes

Before submitting a pull request, ensure your changes work correctly:

**Start the OJP server** (required for running tests):
```bash
mvn verify -pl ojp-server -Prun-ojp-server
```

**Run tests** (in a separate terminal, navigate to ojp-jdbc-driver):
```bash
cd ojp-jdbc-driver
mvn test -DenableH2Tests=true
```

**Note**: By default, all database tests are disabled. Use the appropriate enable flags for specific databases:
- `-DenableH2Tests=true` - H2 database tests
- `-DenablePostgresTests=true` - PostgreSQL tests
- `-DenableMySQLTests=true` - MySQL tests
- `-DenableMariaDBTests=true` - MariaDB tests
- `-DenableCockroachDBTests=true` - CockroachDB tests
- `-DenableOracleTests=true` - Oracle tests (requires manual setup)
- `-DenableSqlServerTests=true` - SQL Server tests

For setting up local databases, see [Run Local Databases](https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp/blob/main/documents/environment-setup/run-local-databases.md).

### 4. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add connection timeout configuration to JDBC driver"
```

**Good commit message examples**:
- `Fix null pointer exception in ResultSet.getString()`
- `Add support for PostgreSQL array types`
- `Update README with Docker installation instructions`
- `Improve error handling in connection pool`

**Avoid**:
- `Fixed stuff`
- `Update`
- `WIP`

### 5. Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/add-connection-timeout
```

## Linking Issues to Pull Requests

**This is critical**: Properly linking your PR to an issue ensures that the issue is automatically closed when your PR is merged.

### Using GitHub Keywords

GitHub automatically links and closes issues when you use specific keywords in your PR description or commit messages. Use one of the following formats:

**In the PR description** (recommended):
```markdown
Fixes #123
Closes #123
Resolves #123
```

**Multiple issues**:
```markdown
Fixes #123, fixes #124
Resolves #123 and closes #124
```

**In commit messages**:
```bash
git commit -m "Fix connection timeout issue

Fixes #123"
```

### Supported Keywords

GitHub recognizes the following keywords for automatic issue closing:
- `close`, `closes`, `closed`
- `fix`, `fixes`, `fixed`
- `resolve`, `resolves`, `resolved`

### Best Practices for Issue Linking

1. **Always reference an issue**: Before starting work, check if an issue exists. If not, create one to discuss the problem or feature.

2. **Use the PR description**: Add the linking keyword in the PR description (not just the title) for clarity.

3. **Link early**: Add the issue reference when you create the PR, not later.

4. **One issue per PR when possible**: Keep PRs focused. If fixing multiple unrelated issues, consider separate PRs.

5. **Example PR description**:
   ```markdown
   ## Description
   This PR adds connection timeout configuration to the JDBC driver.
   
   ## Changes
   - Added `connectionTimeout` property to `OjpDataSource`
   - Updated configuration documentation
   - Added unit tests for timeout behavior
   
   ## Testing
   - Tested with H2 database
   - Verified timeout behavior with slow connections
   
   Fixes #123
   ```

6. **Cross-repository references**: If referencing an issue in another repository:
   ```markdown
   Fixes Open-J-Proxy/ojp-docs#45
   ```

---

## Code Style and Conventions

### Java Code Style

- **Follow standard Java conventions**: Use camelCase for variables and methods, PascalCase for classes
- **Use Lombok annotations**: This project uses Lombok for boilerplate reduction (`@Getter`, `@Setter`, `@Builder`, etc.)
- **Meaningful names**: Use descriptive variable and method names
- **Comments**: Add comments only when necessary to explain complex logic. Code should be self-documenting when possible
- **Formatting**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces for Java files)

### Project Structure

OJP is a multi-module Maven project:
- **ojp-grpc-commons**: Shared gRPC protocol definitions
- **ojp-jdbc-driver**: JDBC driver implementation
- **ojp-server**: Proxy server implementation

### Dependencies

- **Minimize new dependencies**: Only add new dependencies when absolutely necessary
- **Use existing libraries**: HikariCP for connection pooling, gRPC for communication, OpenTelemetry for observability
- **License compatibility**: Ensure any new dependencies use Apache 2.0 compatible licenses

---

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage

- **All new features must include tests**: Integration tests are preferred for database-related functionality (transactions, queries, connection management). Unit tests are best for functionality not tied to database behavior (e.g., load balancing, circuit breaker logic).
- **Bug fixes must include regression tests**: Ensure the bug doesn't happen again
- **Maintain or improve coverage**: Don't decrease overall test coverage

### Test Types

1. **Integration Tests** (preferred for database behavior): Test interaction between components with real databases, including transactions, query execution, and connection management
2. **Unit Tests** (for non-database logic): Test individual classes and methods in isolation, best for logic like load balancing or circuit breaker functionality
3. **Multinode Tests**: Test high-availability scenarios (see [Multinode Configuration](https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp/blob/main/documents/multinode/README.md))

### Writing Tests

- Use **JUnit 5** for test framework
- Follow existing test patterns in the codebase
- Use **meaningful test names** that describe what is being tested:
  ```java
  @Test
  void shouldReturnNullWhenColumnDoesNotExist() {
      // test implementation
  }
  ```

### CI/CD Testing

Tests run automatically in GitHub Actions:
- **Main CI**: Runs H2 tests first (fast fail-fast mechanism)
- **Specialized Jobs**: Run only after Main CI succeeds (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, CockroachDB, Oracle, SQL Server, DB2)

For more details, see [Setup and Testing OJP Source](https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp/blob/main/documents/code-contributions/setup_and_testing_ojp_source.md).
