A type 3 JDBC Driver and Layer 7 Proxy Server to decouple applications from relational database connection management.

_"The only open-source JDBC Type 3 driver globally, this project introduces a transparent Quality-of-Service layer that decouples application performance from database bottlenecks. It's a must-try for any team struggling with data access contention, offering easy-to-implement back-pressure and pooling management." (Bruno Bossola - Java Champion and CTO @ Meterian.io)_

## Value Proposition

OJP protects your databases from overwhelming connection storms by acting as a smart backpressure mechanism. Instead of every application instance opening and holding connections, OJP orchestrates and optimizes database access through intelligent pooling, query flow control, and multi-database support. With minimal configuration changes, you replace native JDBC drivers gaining connection resilience, and safer scalability. Elastic scaling becomes simpler without putting your database at risk.

---
## Requirements

- **OJP JDBC Driver**: Java 11 or higher
- **OJP Server**: Java 21 or higher

---
## Quick Start

Get OJP running in under 5 minutes:

### 1. Start OJP Server (Docker - Batteries Included)
```bash
# Includes H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB drivers
docker run --rm -d --network host rrobetti/ojp:0.3.1-beta
```

**Alternative: Runnable JAR (No Docker)**

```bash
# Download OJP Server JAR and open source drivers
cd ojp-server
bash download-drivers.sh  # Downloads H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB
java -jar ojp-server-0.3.2-snapshot-shaded.jar
```

📖 See [Executable JAR Setup Guide](documents/runnable-jar/README.md) for details.

### 2. Add OJP JDBC Driver to your project
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.openjproxy</groupId>
    <artifactId>ojp-jdbc-driver</artifactId>
    <version>0.3.1-beta</version>
</dependency>
```

### 3. Update your JDBC URL
Replace your existing connection URL by prefixing with `ojp[host:port]_`:

```java
// Before (PostgreSQL example)
"jdbc:postgresql://user@localhost/mydb"

// After  
"jdbc:ojp[localhost:1059]_postgresql://user@localhost/mydb"

// Oracle example
"jdbc:ojp[localhost:1059]_oracle:thin:@localhost:1521/XEPDB1"

// SQL Server example
"jdbc:ojp[localhost:1059]_sqlserver://localhost:1433;databaseName=mydb"
```
Use the ojp driver: `org.openjproxy.jdbc.Driver`

That's it! Your application now uses intelligent connection pooling through OJP.

**Note**: Docker images include H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MariaDB drivers by default. For proprietary databases (Oracle, SQL Server, DB2), see the [Drop-In Driver Documentation](documents/configuration/DRIVERS_AND_LIBS.md).

## Alternative Setup: Executable JAR (No Docker)

If Docker is not available in your environment, you can build and run OJP Server as a standalone JAR file:

📖 **[Executable JAR Setup Guide](documents/runnable-jar/README.md)** - Complete instructions for building and running OJP Server as a standalone executable JAR with all dependencies included.

### High Level Solution

<img src="documents/designs/ojp_high_level_design.gif" alt="OJP High Level Design" />

* The OJP JDBC driver is used as a replacement for the native JDBC driver(s) previously used with minimal change, the only change required being prefixing the connection URL with `ojp_`. 
* **Open Source**: OJP is an open-source project that is free to use, modify, and distribute.
* The OJP server is deployed as an independent service that serves as a smart proxy between the application(s) and their respective relational database(s), controlling the number of connections open against each database.
* **Smart Connection Management**: The proxy ensures that database connections are allocated only when needed, improving scalability and resource utilization.
* **Elastic Scalability**: OJP allows client applications to scale elastically without increasing the pressure on the database.
* **gRPC Protocol** is used to facilitate the connection between the OJP JDBC Driver and the OJP Server, allowing for efficient data transmission over a multiplexed channel.
* OJP Server uses **HikariCP** connection pools to efficiently manage connections.
* OJP supports **multiple relational databases** - in theory it can support any relational database that provides a JDBC driver implementation.
* OJP simple setup just requires the OJP library in the classpath and the OJP prefix added to the connection URL (e.g., `jdbc:ojp[host:port]_h2:~/test` where `host:port` represents the location of the OJP server).
* **Drop-In External Libraries**: Add proprietary JDBC drivers (Oracle, SQL Server, DB2) and additional libraries (e.g., Oracle UCP) without recompiling - see [Drop-In Driver Documentation](documents/configuration/DRIVERS_AND_LIBS.md). Simply place JARs in the `ojp-libs` directory.
* **SQL Query Optimization**: Optional SQL enhancer with Apache Calcite provides query optimization using real database schema metadata for improved performance analysis and dialect translation.
