### XA Pool Implementation Analysis
**File**: [XA_POOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md](XA_POOL_IMPLEMENTATION_ANALYSIS.md)  
**Date**: 2025-12-20  
**Status**: Draft for Review

Comprehensive analysis of implementing XA-aware backend session pooling with Apache Commons Pool 2 in OJP proxy server.

**Key Topics**:
- Current connection pool SPI architecture
- XA vs standard connection pooling differences
- Apache Commons Pool 2 fit analysis
- SPI extension evaluation (conclusion: NOT needed)
- Two-layer architecture design
- Implementation roadmap (4 phases)
- Questions, concerns, and recommendations

**Summary**: Proposes XA-specific pooling layer using Commons Pool 2, separate from the existing ConnectionPoolProvider SPI. Includes detailed component design, state machine requirements, durability considerations, and phased implementation plan.

## Analysis Best Practices

- **Be Thorough**: Cover all aspects including architecture, risks, and alternatives
- **Include Diagrams**: Use ASCII art, mermaid, or link to external diagrams
- **Document Decisions**: Explain *why* not just *what*
- **Consider Trade-offs**: Every design has pros and cons
- **Ask Questions**: Better to identify unknowns upfront
- **Provide Opinions**: Architecture requires judgment calls
- **Link to Code**: Reference existing implementations when relevant
- **Think Long-term**: Consider maintenance, testing, evolution
