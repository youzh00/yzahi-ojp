# Driver Externalization Implementation - Final Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of moving open source JDBC drivers (H2, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB) from embedded dependencies in `pom.xml` to external loading via the `ojp-libs` directory mechanism.

**Implementation Date:** December 2024  
**Status:** Complete ✅

## Objectives Achieved

### Primary Goals
1. ✅ Remove open source driver dependencies from `pom.xml`
2. ✅ Reduce JAR size from 70MB to 20MB (50MB / 71% reduction)
3. ✅ Enable customer flexibility for driver version management
4. ✅ Maintain "batteries included" Docker experience
5. ✅ Consistent driver loading mechanism for all drivers (open source + proprietary)

### Secondary Benefits
- Customers can easily update driver versions without rebuilding OJP
- Customers can remove unwanted drivers for security/compliance
- Customers can add custom or patched drivers
- Simplified security scanning of drivers (separate from OJP JAR)
- All drivers now load from `ojp-libs` directory

## Implementation Phases

## Technical Architecture

### Driver Loading Mechanism

**Before:**
```
pom.xml dependencies → Maven → Shaded JAR (70MB)
                                ├── H2 driver
                                ├── PostgreSQL driver
                                ├── MySQL driver
                                └── MariaDB driver
```

**After:**
```
ojp-libs directory → DriverLoader → URLClassLoader → DriverShim → DriverManager
                     ├── H2 driver (2.6MB)
                     ├── PostgreSQL driver (1.1MB)
                     ├── MySQL driver (2.5MB)
                     └── MariaDB driver (726KB)

OJP Server JAR (20MB) - No embedded drivers
```

### Key Components

1. **DriverLoader** (`ojp-server/src/main/java/org/openjproxy/grpc/server/utils/DriverLoader.java`)
   - Loads JDBC drivers from `ojp-libs` directory using URLClassLoader
   - Wraps drivers in DriverShim for proper registration
   - Handles both JAR files and directories

2. **DriverShim** (`ojp-server/src/main/java/org/openjproxy/grpc/server/utils/DriverLoader.java`)
   - Wrapper for JDBC drivers loaded from external JARs
   - Ensures proper delegation to wrapped driver
   - Exposes wrapped driver class name for verification

3. **DriverUtils** (`ojp-server/src/main/java/org/openjproxy/grpc/server/utils/DriverUtils.java`)
   - Centralized driver loading and verification
   - Consistent error messages and success logging
   - Checks both classpath and DriverManager registry

4. **download-drivers.sh** (`ojp-server/download-drivers.sh`)
   - Automated script to download open source drivers from Maven Central
   - Cross-platform compatible (curl/wget)
   - Idempotent operation

5. **docker-build.sh** (`ojp-server/docker-build.sh`)
   - Automated Docker build with driver download
   - Supports both local builds and registry pushes

## Customer Usage

### Docker Users (Recommended)

Docker images include all open source drivers by default - no action needed:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/open-j-proxy/ojp:latest
docker run -p 1059:1059 ghcr.io/open-j-proxy/ojp:latest
```

**Pre-installed drivers:**
- H2 2.3.232
- PostgreSQL 42.7.8
- MySQL 9.5.0
- MariaDB 3.5.2

### JAR Users

**Step 1: Download OJP Server JAR** (20MB)
```bash
wget https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp/releases/download/v0.3.2/ojp-server.jar
```

**Step 2: Download Open Source Drivers** (~7MB)
```bash
cd ojp-server
bash download-drivers.sh
```

This creates `./ojp-libs/` with all 4 open source drivers.

**Step 3: Run OJP Server**
```bash
java -jar ojp-server.jar
```

### Advanced Use Cases

**1. Use Only Specific Drivers**
```bash
mkdir ojp-libs
cp postgresql-42.7.8.jar ojp-libs/
java -jar ojp-server.jar  # Only PostgreSQL available
```

**2. Use Different Driver Version**
```bash
mkdir ojp-libs
# Download specific version from Maven Central
wget -O ojp-libs/postgresql-42.5.0.jar \
  https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/postgresql/postgresql/42.5.0/postgresql-42.5.0.jar
java -jar ojp-server.jar
```

**3. Add Proprietary Drivers**
```bash
mkdir ojp-libs
# Download open source drivers
bash download-drivers.sh
# Add Oracle driver (download manually from Oracle)
cp ojdbc11.jar ojp-libs/
java -jar ojp-server.jar
```

**4. Security Scanning**
```bash
# Scan drivers separately from OJP
scan-tool ./ojp-libs/*.jar
```

## Developer Workflow

### Local Development Setup

**Step 1: Clone Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Open-J-Proxy/ojp.git
cd ojp
```

**Step 2: Download Open Source Drivers**
```bash
cd ojp-server
bash download-drivers.sh
cd ..
```

This creates `ojp-libs/` at repository root with all 4 open source drivers.

**Step 3: Build Project**
```bash
mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

**Step 4: Start OJP Server**

From repository root:
```bash
mvn verify -pl ojp-server -Prun-ojp-server
```

The server will automatically load drivers from `./ojp-libs/`.

**Step 5: Run Tests**

In a separate terminal:
```bash
cd ojp-jdbc-driver
mvn test -DenableH2Tests=true
```

### CI/CD Pipeline

All CI jobs automatically download drivers before starting tests:

```yaml
- name: Download Open Source Drivers
  run: cd ojp-server && bash download-drivers.sh ../ojp-libs
```

Drivers are downloaded to `./ojp-libs/` at repository root, matching the default path OJP Server uses.
